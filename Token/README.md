#### Blockchain Infrastructure 

Blockchain Technology can enhance the basic services that are
essential in traditional finance and it has the potential to become the
foundation for decentralized business models, empowering entrepreneurs and
innovators with all the right tools. By means of a trustless and distributed
infrastructure, blockchain technology is optimizing transactional costs and
allows the rise of decentralized, innovative, interoperable, borderless and
transparent applications which facilitate open access and encourage
permissionless innovations. 

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain that was developed as a means of utilizing solidity-based
smart contracts with much greater speed and efficiency than other, competing chains.
With decentralized exchanges on BSC offering lightning-fast swaps and extremely low
fees, BSC has started to become one of the most widely used blockchains for
Decentralized Finance (Defi). BSC uses a token protocol developed by the
Binance Team called BEP-20.

    Total Supply: 1,000,000,000   
    Dev wallet: 
    10% of fees burned with each transaction.
